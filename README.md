# Meteor.js Chat
*A simple chat written for [Meteor.js](https://meteor.com/)*

## What it was
I was thinking of writing a simple chat with Meteor for a while now.
The first one was coded in about 30 minutes.

## Whats up next?
I like this chat a little so I'm gonna be donin' a little tweaking now and then...
